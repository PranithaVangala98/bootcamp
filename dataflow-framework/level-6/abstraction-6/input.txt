Okay, here's an example input file named input.txt that you can use to test the pipeline. It includes lines that should flow through different paths of your state transition engine.

input.txt content:

  This is a general message.
Warning: Something went wrong but it's not critical.
  Another line of general information.
ERROR: Critical system failure detected.
   Just a regular line.
Warning: Disk space low.
An unexpected fatal Error occurred!
This is fine.
