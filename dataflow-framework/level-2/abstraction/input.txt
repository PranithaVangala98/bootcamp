Context-driven testing emphasizes tailoring testing strategies to the specific circumstances of a project, rather than rigidly adhering to predefined methodologies. It involves considering factors like project requirements, resources, and deadlines to optimize testing efforts. 
Key aspects of context-driven testing:
Adaptability:
It's not a rigid set of techniques but a mindset focused on adapting testing methods to the project's needs.
Flexibility:
It allows testers to choose the most appropriate testing techniques based on the context, rather than following a one-size-fits-all approach.
Emphasis on Project Specifics:
It prioritizes understanding the project's unique characteristics and using that knowledge to guide testing activities.
Resource Allocation:
It helps determine the most effective way to allocate testing resources, focusing on the most critical aspects of the project.
